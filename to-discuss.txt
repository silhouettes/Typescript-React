Talk about:
- Modules
- Live reload
- Source maps & debugging
- Profiling
- Syntax highlighting/intellisense/editors (ts project?)
- ES6
- Test frameworks
- SASS
- Which typescript compiler
- External libraries

JSX-Typescript:
- No ES6 support
- React import can be optimized out
- No typescript definition for Reflux (i.e. limited support for smaller libraries)

Intellisense:
- Works fine in VSCode and VS
- Sublime seems to be using auto-complete, can't figure out why

Compiler:
- Is managed by ts-loader/package.json for build, as well as Visual Studio .csproj, and requires VS extension
- Sublime uses our typescript-sublime and will be on edge. VSCode ships with ts 1.5.0 beta support.

Build:
- Use command line
- May be able to configure a tasks.json file to run tasks in VSCode (and VS in the future)


tsconfig.json vs csproj
May need to constantly update csproj
